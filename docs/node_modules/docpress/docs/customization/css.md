# Custom CSS

Put your extra CSS files inside the `css` setting. You can put external files (hosted online), Stylus files (ends in `.styl`), or local CSS files. For Stylus files and local CSS files, they need to be inside `docs/`.

##### docpress.json
<!-- {.file-heading} -->

```json
{
  "css": [
    "http://site.com/external.css",
    "docs/style.styl",
    "docs/extra.css"
  ]
}
```
